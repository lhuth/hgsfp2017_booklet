\subsection*{Jets to the future: Boosted boson and top jets as a probe for new
  physics}
\subsection*{C. F. Anders, Uni Heidelberg}
\noindent The high energies at the Large Hadron Collider allow for unique new reconstruction methods of heavy particles that decay into hadrons. High energy or "boosted" W, Z and Higgs Bosons, as well as top quarks, can be reconstructed in a single large jet and they can be distinguished from QCD jet backgrounds by analysis of the jet substructure. 
Many searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be improved using these techniques, e.g. di-top quark or di-boson resonance searches or searches for Vector-Like quarks.\newline
In this lecture, jets at ATLAS, jet substructure techniques and their application in physics searches and measurements will be introduced and discussed.
