\subsection*{Engineering static and dynamical gauge fields with ultracold matter}
\subsection*{F. Jendrzejewski, Uni Heidelberg}
\noindent
Gauge field dynamics have attracted considerable interest over the last few
years. In this course, we
will discuss the experimental tools that enabled the precise study of such
systems with ultracold
matter. First, we look into the techniques that enabled the study of static
gauge fields, similar to
actual magnetic fields, with neutral atoms. Then we will move on the
challenges to extend the
approaches to dynamical gauge fields, which would allow for the quantum
simulation of high-
energy problems and finally discuss first experimental results.
