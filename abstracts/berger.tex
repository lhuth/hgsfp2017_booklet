\noindent What are the bound states of the strong interaction? Is there something beyond meson (quark-antiquark) and baryon (three quark) states? Recent discoveries, especially in the charm quark sector, challenge our understanding of the bound states of the strong interaction. The lecture discusses these discoveries and the attempts at theoretical understanding, giving insights into a rapidly changing field of particle physics.
