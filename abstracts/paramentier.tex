\subsection*{Star Clusters and Star Cluster Systems}
\subsection*{G. Parmentier, Uni Heidelberg}
\noindent Clusters of stars represent a major channel of star formation and
hold therefore the potential to trace the star formation history of galaxies.
There is still a long way to go before reaching that goal, however.
Firstly, a significant fraction of the star clusters of any galaxy remains
undetected.  Secondly, star clusters 'dissolve' (i.e. they lose stars) as time
goes by, at a rate depending on both cluster formation and
environmental conditions.  Building on the cluster age-mass diagram and
on a cluster formation model, I will illustrate these two issues.
