\subsection*{Fundamental principles and their realisation in physical laws}
\subsection*{B. M. Sch\"afer, Uni Heidelberg}
\noindent This course is intended to be guided discussion about fundamental principles and how they are realised in classical and modern physics. We will discuss hidden and implicit assumptions in basic formalisms and talk about (hopefully unusual) approaches to modern physics, in particular the construction of field theories including general relativity and electrodynamics. We will conclude with a discussion of general relativity in everyday life - and Iâ€™m serious about this.
