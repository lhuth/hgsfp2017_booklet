\subsection*{From riots to raves: Modeling collective human behavior to avoid catastrophe}
\subsection*{Monica Dunford, Uni Heidelberg}
\noindent Why do some protests become riots and others stay peaceful? What
triggers a crowd to panic resulting in people being trampled to death?

future crowd catastrophes. This lecture will discuss models that attempt to
predict the behavior of crowds with high emotional intensity and often
alcohol, drugs and weaponry.
