\section{Report Winter School 2017}

This document concludes the 10th HGSFP Winter School, which took place for the tenth time at the University Center in Obergurgl, Austria from January 27th 2017 to January 31st 2017. In total 49 students - as we had one cancellations at short notice due to illness, we could not fill all 50 places - attended the lectures and participated in the poster sessions and social activities at the center and in the Obergurgl ski area. 

\subsection*{Bus transfer from and to Heidelberg}
TODO: Heiko

\subsection*{The venue}

The staff at the University Center was very friendly, helpfull and supported
us during the complete time. Room changes on short notice and changes in the
timeslot for the coffe breaks could be done without any issues. 
Dinner and breakfast were delicious and special food request like
vegan/vegesterin and gluten free could be taken into account.\newline
The rooms were clean and towels were provided. 
\subsection*{Scientific program}

\noindent The scientific program consisted of three main parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item The scientific talks, on topics representing all the HGSFP branches and with the aim of introducing the research conducted at the different institutes in an accessible way to non-experts in the area.
\item The two poster sessions, during which all participants presented their research. For the first time, this year the sessions started with a \textit{elevator pitch} session, in which every student had one minute to introduce their poster.
\item The special invitation talk, which by tradition has a wider scientific scope than the subject specific talks.
\end{itemize}

The lecture schedule (see Appendix A), easily available in the provided book of abstracts, encouraged all participants to attend lectures on topics different from their research subjects. The lecturers stayed at the University Center for either the entire school or part of it, thus giving lots of opportunities to discuss their talks and projects with them in a relaxed environment. \\
During the two poster sessions the participants presented their research to each other. Despite the tough schedule the discussions during these evenings were very intense and fruitful. With the lectures as a common basis the posters often served as a source for in-depth discussions of various theoretical and experimental phenomena.\\
Every student got the chance to present her/his poster in an one-minute elevator pitch. To practice and improve these presentations the school has provided a special session in which some positive examples were given and discussed.\\
The invitation lecture this year has focussed on the modelling of collective human behavior and discussed a way to use tools that are commonly used in physics also in difference branches of science. 

\subsection*{Social event}
The social event took place on Friday evening, the first evening of the winterschool. Following the success of the last years, we went to play curling at the ice-skating rink in Obergurgl. Ten teams of five people were selected randomly such that the students from different branches could get to know each other. After many enthusiastic games, kindly supervised by Arnold Kuen and his colleague, one team was celebrated as the evening's winner.\\ The social event was again a very successful event as became clear from the many positive reactions of the participants.
%
%
%The first evening of the Winter School was devoted to a social event - Eisstockschie{\ss}en - which is by now a tradition of this school. The local supervision was very nice and the evening as a whole very appreciated by the participants.\\
%
%A new organising commitee for next year's Winter School was already formed during this Winter School. Although the accommodation facilities were well appreciated by all participants, we have animated the new committee to search for possible cheaper alternatives for the Winter School in 2018 as the expenses for accommodation at the University Center in Obergurgl have steadily increased over the last couple of years.
%\\
%The results of the evaluation sheets are presented in Appendix B, showing that the school in general and the scientific program in particular was well received by the participating students.\\

\subsection*{Acknowledgement}

\noindent We want to thank the Heidelberg Graduate School of Fundamental Physics (HGSFP) for the financial support that made the 2017 Winter School possible.

\subsection{Comments from participants: What did you miss?}
\begin{itemize}
\item I miss my family
\item my virginity
\item free beer
\item more details before hand would be a help for packing
\item pen & paper (goody bag)
\item add a wooden stick for pointing (conference room)
\item Maybe a lecturer dinner, or gather the lecturers a at a given table for just the 1st evening to help us get acquainted with each other.(especially as we are not all from Heidelberg)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments from participants: Important remarks not covered in survey}
\begin{itemize}
\item The judgement of the poster session should be more professional in my opinion. It would be really nice if it is decided by the lecturers. Because of you choose lecturers instead of student it will be less biased. Overall very nice organisation and the organisation team was really helpful. Thanks for that.
\item I think the documentary was already watched for several people before. I am not sure if you mentioned before, but at least I did not know lunch was not provided. However, this was a great school and experience. Thank you!
\item It'd been been nice to have alternative activities to skiing, like ice-hockey or curling. Those were fun and "social" but only the first and the last days.
\item Good job!
\item No complaints.\\ The HGSFP was Awesome! :D\\ A SciFi movie instead of a documentary would've been cool. :)
\item It was a really fun trip. The night drive was completely ok with me and I really enjoyed the skiing in the Friday (and on all the other days of course :) ) The location is also really cool, tasty food, clean and with a sauna!\\ Thank you.
\item Instead of the sociology lecture, i would have prefer something more related to science. Instead of a documentary, a SciFi movie.
\item Thanks for the very good organization.
\item Where is the free beer?
\item social event was great fun - maybe one or two more of those.
\item Some of the service personal were REALLY unfriendly \(\rightarrow\) You don't say to a customer the his order annoys you!\\ Pfui, pfui, very bad
\item Thanks a lot to the organizers for this great school!
\item Big thank you to the organizers! I had a great time and even learned something ;)
\item Once the school poster is ready and on the web, please send an email to the lecturers, so that we know who is going.
\item Maybe send the email with all the practical information a bit earlier. (as I am teaching on Thursday afternoon, I wish I could have known earlier about the departure time.)
\end{itemize}
